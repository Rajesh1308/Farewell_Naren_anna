  <h1>My Dear Anna</h1>
  <div class="line"> 
    <p>I still remember, I first saw your pic in LinkedIn and you are the first person I admired a lot before being a part of GCT.</p>
    <p>Since I met you, you are inspiring me by your each action, being a motivator supporter and a lot more for me.</p>
    <p>More than a senior, you sometime remove my feeling of longing for a sibling... :)</p>
    <p>I wish I should be along with you forever by any means and hoping it would happen.</p>

    <p>But...</p>
    <p>After all, it's time to depart for a new beginning</p>
    <p>I'm gonna miss you a lot Anna</p>
    <p>It's little hard to take it and accept it... :/</p>
